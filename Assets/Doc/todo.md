# To do (in no particular order)

## v1.0

### In Progress

-   Write high level documentation
-   Create Tlines connections to neighbors instead direct lines 
    - Draw Tlines (done)
    - Add Tline datastructure to layout so it can be used outside the gizmos
        rectA,
        rectB,
        Intersectionline,
        projectionPoint A,
        projectionPoint B,

### Planned
-   Add seed option to LayoutGenerator so the generated map can be controlled

-   Create demo page
    -   Add step
    -   Demo with just the algorithm
    -   Demo with transformations applied

-   Basic unit tests

### Done

-   Add option to Transformations to indicate when to apply (after each iterating, afterCompletion).

### Dismissed / Later

-   find a pretty sky box (eg https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/simple-sky-cartoon-assets-42373)
    - in the current demo you don't really see the sky box, doesn't justify including the assets

-   Add blocks as if it was a city
