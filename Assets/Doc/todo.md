# To do (in no particular order)

## v2.0: Refactoring & Bugfixing

### Planned

-   Add warning if no prefab is defined in the layout generator.
-   Gizmos are not drawn correctly when the object containing the layout generator is moved.
-   (1) Refactor LayoutGeneration so each step is a transformation, starting with a rectangle.
-   (2) Add AABSP transformation as a start.
-   Should be able to set the number of divisions to any number (not necessarily even). To do so track the 'depth' in the AABSP.
-   Add unit tests.

- Add demo for AABSP.
